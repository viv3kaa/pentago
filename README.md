PS0001 Intro to Computing- Pentago Project
Try playing this mini game of pentago!
You can either play with your friend or the computer itself, just choose accordingly!
Just some things to take note:
1. The goal is to get a whole row, column or diagonal of 5
2. The 6x6 board is divided into 4 3x3 sub boards
3. Every move, you can place your counter in by choosing the row and column, followed by a rotation of one of the subboards
4. There are 8 possible rotations. rot = 1, rotates the top left board by 90 deg anticlockwise while rot = 2 does the same clockwise
5. all odd rots produce anticlockwise rotations, while all even rots produce clockwise rotation
6. rots 1/2 is for the top left board, rot 3/4 is for the top right board, rot 5/6 is for the bottom left board, rot 7/8 is for the bottom right board
